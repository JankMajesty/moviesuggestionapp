# moviesuggestionapp

I am creating an app that will suggest movies to a user based on their preferences. 

There are three tables I need to make it work:

1. users table
2. userPreferences table
3. movies table

In order for this to work, we will need to match the userPreferences table with the movies table. I plan to use the OMDB api to match with the userPreferences table and make suggestions based on how many user preferences match the movies data.
